Download Fastqc
link: https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/
Open the file and transfer the file to applications

Download Fasta and GTF files
Link: https://uswest.ensembl.org/Rattus_norvegicus/Info/Index
Look for files in genome annotation:
	Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.104.gtf.gz - GTF
	Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.dna.toplevel.fa.gz - Fasta (toplevel biggest file)

Download cutadapt (how?)

Create APA Analysis folder in documents meant to hold everything will download such as fastq files and packages

Download Rnor6 reference genome 
Process fastq file is Ved's data from 3' MACE-seq of oligodendrocyte projection-enriched RNA

Open terminal to build bowtie index for genome
command: Bowtie2-build ref/Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.dna.toplevel.fa Rnor_6 (ref is folder in apa analysis, file name after which is the genome, and new name at the end)
Downloading package will take from 30-45 mins

Align fastqc to genome using bowtie commands
Link: http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/manual.shtml#aligning-example-reads
Need to be in apa_analysis (ref is going one level deeper)
Command: bowtie2 -x ref/Rnor_6 -U fastq/Proces_cleaned.fastq -b aligned/projections.bam (/ inputting into folder)
Following command: bowtie2 -x ref/Rnor_6 -U fastq/Proces_cleaned.fastq -S aligned/projections.sam

Handy Know Hows:
	-x = basename index file of ref. genome (looks for prefix, path to folder, shared name)
	-U = comma separting lists of unpaired reads to be aligned
	-S = file to write SAM alignments

Note: the default for commands is print into terminal, output non-error results into terminal

Install samtools 
command: brew install samtools

Convert SAM to BAM File:
command: samtools view -S -b aligned/projections.sam > aligned/projections.bam (> stream redirect from print to save to file)

Files Info:
FASTA file = sequence file for ref data (ex. Rat genome)
FASTQ file = list of sequencing data with quality scores (to read)
SAM file = Sequence Alignment Map, alignnmnet of fastq file to ref genome (lots of data)
BAM file = Binary Alignment Map, compact binary file from SAM
BED file = Browser Extensible Data, format represents genomic features and annotations
BED file - reads about alignments, chromosome #, start/end alignemnt, name read, quality, +/- strand alignment (sense/anti-sense)

Commands to keep in mind:
cat <example> | opens files
ls -lh | shows info on files in directory
mv Rnor6.bam processed.bam | rename files

To look inside BAM file
command: head aligned/projections.bam looking at file

Convert BAM to BED File:
link: https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/bamtobed.html
command: bedtools bamtobed -i aligned/projections.bam > aligned/projections.bed

Repeat for Soma Processed file
Commands:
bowtie2 -x ref/Rnor_6 -U fastq/Soma_cleaned.fastq -b aligned/processed.bam
bowtie2 -x ref/Rnor_6 -U fastq/Soma_cleaned.fastq -S aligned/processed.sam
samtools view -S -b aligned/processed.sam > aligned/processed.bam
head aligned/processed.bam
bedtools bamtobed -i aligned/processed.bam > aligned/processed.bed (remove default print using >)

Goal: map out ends RNA molecules, multiple sizes of RNA 
alignments how do we know which genes those are and getting name of gene
Bed tools tells us where files intersect
closest - range in file a closest range in file b, exons stop codon eveyrhint after that UTR, gene that is upstream of read aligned bc that is gene corresponding to wnat things upstream
-s same strand

command to subset gtf files to slice for stop codons, use closest command for upstream stop codon (give another file)

alternative poly adenlyation
how we are looking at it (flow chart: steps, tools and end goal: which genes have multple 3' isoforms and metanalaysi )

Done: rm gz
Done: Sort function - .sorted.bed (output: chromosome, location both bed files)
Done: grep "stop_codon" [] > rnor6_stopcodons.gtf (annotation gtf file)
Working on it: closest upstream stop codons

Things to read about:
- GTF files
- Bedtools
- Grep

Sort bed files using Bedtools:
command: sortBed -i aligned/projections.bed > aligned/sortedprojections.bed #Projections is processed and processed is Soma
command: sortBed -i aligned/processed.bed > aligned/sortedprocessed.bed

Group GTF file by stop codons:
command: grep "stop_codon" ref/Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.104.gtf > ref/rnor6_stopcodons.gtf

Looking for upstream stop codons:
link: https://bedtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/tools/closest.html
command: bedtools closest -D ref -fu -a aligned/sortedprojections.bed -b ref/Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.104.gtf > aligned/stopcodonsprojections.bed
command: bedtools closest -D ref -fu -a aligned/sortedprocessed.bed -b ref/Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.104.gtf > aligned/stopcodonsprojections.bed

Sorting a GTF file:
comand maybe: wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.github.com/ctokheim/PrimerSeq/master/gtf.py -O gtf.py
brew install wget for command to work
http://primerseq.sourceforge.net/gtf.html
python2 gtf.py -c ref/Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.104.gtf (not working)

command: sortBed -i ref/Rattus_norvegicus.Rnor_6.0.104.gtf > ref/rnor6sorted.gtf (bedtools accept gtf)

Grep filtering stop codons for sorted:
grep "stop_codon" ref/rnor6sorted.gtf > ref/rnor6_stopcodons_sorted.gtf

Closest looking upstream stop_codons:
command: bedtools closest -D ref -fu -a aligned/sortedprojections.bed -b ref/rnor6_stopcodons_sorted.gtf > closest/stopcodonsprojections.bed

Making pipeline with multiple, output UTR, multiple samples and compare

Rename proceessed -> Soma
