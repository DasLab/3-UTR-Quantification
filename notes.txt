Notes on Plots and Genes

Peaks for soma and projections are aligned
Most genes have peaks in the beginning (ex. at 200> bps) like at stop codons
Exponential increase, then drop

Ap2s1 -> 2 peaks, projections peak greater at the beginning and decreases in the 2nd peak, inverse relationship with soma (different from expected)
Gas7 -> looks strange, 2 main peaks but not aligned, a lot of information around it
LOC10 -> 0.40 frequency peak
Grina -> piling of peaks
Mapt -> 4 peaks, projections is greatest 

Projection tend to be greater in frequnecy than soma

Peaks tend to be more separated than close one after another

Pipeline - have average distances (most common cutoffs?)

Soma peaks tend to cut off earlier if not aligned with projections peaks (ex. Snd1)

AABR07000398.1 -> 4-5 peaks, looks cluttered with a lot of information/isoforms

Does greatest frequency of a gene matter? 

Gng12 -> 2 major peaks looks cool

Mobp gene -> 3 peaks, soma great in beginning projections greater at end
Myelin Associated Oligodendrocyte Basic Protein
Protein Coding gene. Diseases associated with MOBP include Cocaine Abuse and Microphthalmia, Syndromic 10. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations related to this gene include Rab GTPase binding and structural constituent of myelin sheath
